# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis conducted on 2019 data
The purpose of the PyBer analysis was to compare ride-sharing data across diverse city types in order to identify existing disparities that can assist with key business decisions for PyBer. Comparisons between urban, suburban, and rural city types were examined across several metrics to determine the affordability and accessibility of ride-sharing services amongst these key groups. 

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv & ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Anaconda 1.7.2, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Results 

### The following table depicts a summary of important metrics about ride-sharing data across diverse city types:

  ### Summary of findings for suburban cities versus urban cities
  - The total number of rides over a four month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **2.60** times less than urban cities (625 versus 1,625 rides). 
  - The total number of drivers over a four month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **4.91** times less than urban cities (490 versus 2,405).
  - The revenue generated from the total sum of fares over a four month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **$20,498.05** less than urban cities ($19,356.33 
    versus $39,854.38).
  - The average fare per ride over a four month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **$6.44** higher than the average fare per ride for urban cities ($30.97 
    versus $24.53).
  - The average fare per driver over a four month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **$22.93** higher than the average fare per driver for urban cities ($39.50 
    versus $16.57).
    
     
  ### Summary of findings for rural cities versus urban cities
   - The total number of rides over a four month period (January - April) for rural cities was **13** times less than urban cities (125 versus 1,625 rides). 
   - The total number of drivers over a four month period (January - April) for rural cities was **30.83** times less than urban cities (78 versus 2,405).
   - The revenue generated from the total sum of fares over a four month period (January - April) for rural cities was **$35,526.45** less than urban cities ($4,327.93
      versus $39,854.38).
   - The average fare per ride over a four month period (January - April) for rural cities was **$10.09** higher than the average fare per ride for urban cities ($34.62 
      versus $24.53).      
   - The average fare per driver over a four month period (January - April) for rural cities was **$38.92** higher than the average fare per driver for urban cities ($55.49 
     versus $16.57).

### Summary of findings for suburban cities
   - The red line shows the total fares generated within suburban cities over a four month period (January - April). 
   - It appears that the end of the third week of February generated the highest revenue for total fares, i.e., around $14,000.
   - Furthermore, there appears to be a trend showing that total fares decrease slightly towards the end of the months of January through March. 
   - However, April seems to show an opposite trend, where the revenue experiences a sharp decline within the first week but then rises sharply thereafter. 
   - The revenue generated by suburban cities appears better than that for rural cities but substantially lower than the urban cities. 
   - Overall, the revenue generated within this four month period does generally hover around the same level, despite the noticeable peaks and dips mentioned above.

### Summary of findings for rural cities
   - The blue line shows the total fares generated within rural cities over a four month period (January - April). 
   - It appears that the beginning of April generated the highest revenue for total fares, i.e., $500, while the third week of February came close to $500, i.e., ~$450. 
   - There appear to be more steady fluctuations of rising and falling revenues across this four month period.
   - Unfortunately, overall, it is very clear that the revenue generated is hovering around the same level across the entire four month period, despite peaks and dips over 
     time and that amount is dramatically lower than suburban and urban cities. 

## Recommendations

According to the summary statistics comparing city types, urban cities generate the highest revenue when compared to rural and suburban cities. The multiple line chart provides a more detailed visualization of how urban cities generate the highest revenue when compared to rural and suburban cities across a four month period (January - April). Therefore, the results of this analysis illuminate the need for PyBer to focus more attention on suburban and rural cities. Findings clearly show that there are significant problems with the affordability of fares and the accessibility of drivers in rural and suburban cities. One hypothesis to explore would be to consider that this discrepancy is due to the significantly lower number of drivers in rural and suburban cities. Therefore, it is recommended that PyBer:

  - Target more funding towards increasing the number of drivers in rural cities for a three month trial period
  - Target more funding towards increasing the number of drivers in suburban cities for a three month trial period
  - Repeat the same summary statistics comparing rural, suburban, and urban cities across this three month trial period to determine whether this approach will generate
    increased revenue and allow for reduced fare rates
  - Track total revenue generated within rural, suburban, and urban cities across this three month trial period using the same visualization process of a multiple line chart 
    to determine whether the observed trends from January to April remain consistent or change during the three month trial period

If PyBer does see dramatic changes, then it would be recommended for PyBer to extend their trial period through to the end of the calendar year. To truly test the effectiveness of this hypothesis, however, PyBer should continue their strategy of increasing drivers in rural and suburban cities the following calendar year from January to April as a way to test whether or not the revenue generated within this four month period changes dramatically from what was observed in 2019. If so, then increasing the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities may have achieved the intended goals of not ony increasing the accessibility of ride-sharing services across diverse city types, but also increasing the affordability of those services with reduced fares.
