# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of the PyBer analysis was to compare ride-sharing data across diverse city types in order to identify important differences that can assist with key business decisions. Comparisons between urban, suburban, and rural city types were examined across several metrics to determine disparities regarding the affordability and accessibility of ride-sharing services. 

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv & ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Anaconda 1.7.2, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib.Pypolt

## Results 
The following table depicts a summary of important metrics about ride-sharing data between diverse city types:

The findings from this analysis revealed significant disparities between city type, particularly when comparing suburban and rural cities to urban cities:

  ### Summary findings for Suburban cities versus Urban cities
  - The total number of rides over a 4 month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **2.60** times less than urban cities (625 versus 1,625 rides). 
  - The total number of drivers over a 4 month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **4.91** times less than urban cities (490 versus 2,405).
  - The revenue generated from the total sum of fares over a 4 month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **2.06** times less than urban cities ($19,356.33 versus      $39,854.38).
  - The average fare per ride over a 4 month period (January - April) for suburban cities was **$6.44** higher than the average fare per ride for urban cities ($30.97 versus      $24.53).
  ### Summary findings for Rural cities versus Urban cities
   - The total number of rides over a 4 month period (January - April) for rural cities were **4.91** times less than urban cities (125 versus 1,625 rides).
